# MinesweeperClone
A clone of Minesweeper using C# and WinForms


## Roadmap
* Middle Click to highlight nearby unrevealed tiles
* Middle Click will reveal nearby tiles if amount flagged equals the amount of bombs touching
* Double Click revealed tiles to reveal all surrounding tiles
* Counter for Remaining bombs that haven't been flagged
* Incremental timer
* Leaderboard with fastest times
* Difficulty option that changes the amount of bombs and tiles on the board
* Option to scale up the size of board for easier viewing
