* Middle Click revealed tiles to reveal all surrounding tiles
* Counter for Remaining bombs that haven't been flagged
* Incremental timer
* Leaderboard with fastest times
* Difficulty option that changes the amount of bombs and tiles on the board
* Option to scale up the size of board for easier viewing
